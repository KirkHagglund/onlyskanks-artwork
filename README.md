Website design for Sanaria Clarke's digital artwork
As I begin my bootcamp coding journey, I would like to simultaneously work on a project for Sanaria to better advertise and showcase her digital artwork. Beginning with a basic website, the goal is to make it fully interactive and add elements of e-commerce so that purchases and commission requests can be made directly through the website. Good luck, future Kirk!
